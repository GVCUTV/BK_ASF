---

## **Meeting Log — Session 1**

### **1. Validation of Meeting 3 Prompts (3.1 → 3.2D)**

#### ✔ You asked for expanded Codex prompts for Meeting 3 activities

I generated **four separate Codex prompts**:

* **3.1 Analytical model & assumptions**
* **3.2A Equations, state matrix, routing parameters**
* **3.2C Key metrics list**
* **3.2D Simulation model verification** (because marked “Done”, verification-only)

#### ✔ You instructed to:

* **Exclude Draw.io tasks**
* When a task contains diagram work → *explicitly skip it*

All prompts were regenerated accordingly.

---

### **2. Clarification of 3.2B Prompt Absence**

You asked:

> “Why you didn’t generate the Codex prompt for 3.2B?”

I explained:

* 3.2B was **marked as Done** in your meeting notes, with no pending work.
* Under PMCSN rules, Codex prompts are created **only for Pending/Partial/Missing tasks**, or Done tasks needing verification.
* 3.2D required verification, but **3.2B did not**, unless explicitly requested.

You confirmed the logic.

### **3. Merge Request: Insert Markov Impact Analysis into schedule.md**

You asked:

> “Add the information in markov-change_impact_schedule.md into schedule.md, keeping the second one’s format. Option A.”

Where **Option A** =
➡ *Keep existing schedule.md text AND add Impact + Reasoning as extra bullets.*

#### ✔ I merged them exactly following Option A

* Every overlapping section received:
  • **Impact:** …
  • **Reasoning:** …
* Nothing was removed or altered.

---

### **4. Generated the fully merged schedule.md**

I produced a complete updated `schedule.md`, with all impacts and reasonings integrated.

---

### **5. You requested a downloadable file**

Attempt 1: Writing via python_user_visible failed due to:

* content too long,
* Python string literal overflow.

I explained the safe options:

* A = ZIP
* B = direct file (split writing)
* C = manual assembly

You chose:

> **Option B — direct downloadable schedule.md**

I attempted a Python write but it failed due to length limits and cell truncation.

You paused that flow and asked a different question before we retried.

---

### **6. Comparison Task: Check new prompts vs old PMCSN_ASF_Schedule_Prompts.md**

You asked:

> “From point 3.2C ahead, check if the prompts in this chat correspond to the old ones.”

I performed a full **synchronization analysis**:

#### Findings:

* **3.2C — Different**
  Old: generic implementation prompt
  New: specific “Key Metrics List” doc prompt
* **3.2D — Different**
  Old: implement DES developer-state model
  New: verification-only
* **4.1 → 8.3 — Same**
  No newly generated prompts here; the old ones remain canonical.

I provided the full comparison.

---

### **7. You requested this meeting log**

Finally, you asked:

> “Generate a log of everything has been done in today’s meeting”

This document is the final output.

---

### ✅ **End of Meeting Summary**

#### **Today we accomplished:**

* Regenerated all Meeting 3 Codex prompts with Draw.io removal rules.
* Explained and justified absence of 3.2B prompt.
* Fully merged Markov-impact schedule into schedule.md.
* Generated the complete updated schedule.md.
* Provided analysis comparing new prompts vs old reference file.
* Set up the process for generating a downloadable file (ready to resume).
* Produced this final structured meeting log.

If you'd like, I can now:

📦 **Retry generating the downloadable schedule.md file**
🧩 **Regenerate missing Codex prompts (3.2B, 4.x, etc.)**
📚 **Create a compiled “Meeting Log Archive” markdown**
📊 **Update the repository documentation with this meeting’s outcome**

Just tell me what you want next.

### **Meeting Log — Session 2 (Additional Work up to 4.2A)**

#### **4.1 Simulation architecture (events/states) — DONE**
- Verified modular event-driven simulation architecture.
- Confirmed clean separation between:
  - Event classes (`TicketArrivalEvent`, `ServiceCompletionEvent`)
  - Workflow logic (`WorkflowLogic`)
  - System state (`SystemState`, queues, servers)
- Ensured base DES simulation runs end-to-end with no blocking states.
- Added Markov impact notes:
  - Event completions trigger hooks for developer-state transitions.
  - Queue/server mapping clean and policy-agnostic.

#### **4.2A Setup repo/code + input base — DONE**
- Validated initialization of `simulation/` folder (logging, config, structure).
- Confirmed need for runtime loading of:
  - Transition matrix P
  - Stint PMFs
  - Service-time parameters
- Identified missing imports inside `simulate.py`:
  - `GLOBAL_RANDOM_SEED`
  - `SEED_OVERRIDE_ENV_VAR`
  - `STATE_PARAMETER_PATHS`
- Produced Codex prompts instructing how to add these missing fields to `config.py` consistently with repository practices.
- Ensured realistic deterministic seeds and correct state-parameter paths under `data/state_parameters/`.
