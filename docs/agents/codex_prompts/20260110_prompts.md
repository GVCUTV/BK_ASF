# Codex Prompt Suite — 2026-01-10

## Prompt 1 - Analyze Distribution Change (Lognormal → Weibull)

**Goal**  
Determine why the distribution in `fit_summary.csv` for the DEV and TEST phases changed from lognormal to Weibull by analyzing the three consecutive commit diffs captured in `etl/commits_patches.txt`.

**Context**  
`etl/commits_patches.txt` contains the unified diffs of three consecutive commits. The change from lognormal to Weibull appears in `fit_summary.csv` for DEV and TEST phases. The objective is to trace which code or data processing changes in those commits caused the distribution selection to change.

**Files to Read**  
1. `etl/commits_patches.txt` (full file).  
2. `etl/output/csv/fit_summary.csv` (or the current location of the file in the repo if different).  
3. Every file referenced in the diffs that impacts distribution fitting, model selection, or summary CSV generation (e.g., ETL scripts, fitting modules, config files).

**Objectives**  
1. Parse the three commit diffs to identify all changes that could affect:  
   - Distribution fitting logic.  
   - Selection criteria between candidate distributions.  
   - Input data preprocessing for DEV/TEST phases.  
   - CSV output generation for `fit_summary.csv`.  
2. Map each relevant diff hunk to a plausible effect on distribution selection (e.g., parameter changes, data filtering, criteria thresholds).  
3. Determine which specific commit(s) introduced the change from lognormal to Weibull for DEV/TEST and explain the causal chain.  
4. Confirm whether the observed change is due to updated data, changed fitting criteria, or changed code paths.  
5. Produce a concise explanation with evidence tied to the exact diff hunks and file paths.

**Output Requirements**  
- Produce a single Markdown report with:  
  - **Summary of Findings** (what changed and why).  
  - **Commit-by-Commit Analysis** (cite the specific diff hunks responsible).  
  - **Conclusion** (the root cause of the lognormal → Weibull switch for DEV/TEST).  
- Include file paths and line references to the diff hunks from `etl/commits_patches.txt`.  
- Do **not** modify any files.  
- Do **not** run simulations.

**Formatting Rules**  
- One report only, in English.  
- No extra commentary outside the requested report.  
- Clearly identify commit boundaries as they appear in `etl/commits_patches.txt`.

**Definition of Done**  
- The report explains *why* the distribution changed for DEV/TEST, identifies the responsible commit(s), and ties the explanation to concrete diff evidence.  
- All files listed above were read.  
- No file modifications were made.
