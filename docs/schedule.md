# Repository Progress Audit — Expanded Schedule

This expanded schedule replaces tables with detailed bullet lists for clarity.
All time references assume 5 h meetings with ≈ 7.5 net hours of distinct progress (3 semi-parallel resources).

  • Mapped ASF phases to BK foundation tasks.  
  • Outcome: visual shared understanding of workflow.

- **1.3 A (Intro & objectives)** ⚠️ Partial  
  • Intro present in `docs/project_documentation.md` but needs clearer problem statement and goals.  
  • Next: refine text for clarity and academic consistency.

- **1.3 B (First diagrams)** ✅ Done  
  • Exported initial data and architecture diagrams for presentation slides.

- **1.3 C (Data list + JIRA/GitHub exploration)** ✅ Done  
  • Ran ETL queries and validated CSV outputs.  
  • Plotted sample metrics to confirm data integrity.

## Meeting 2 — Conceptual Model & Data Mapping
- **2.1 Finalize conceptual model & flows** ⚠️ Partial  
  • Logical model complete but requires formal diagram finalization.  
  • Action: lock version and export as PDF/SVG for report.

  • Identified main JIRA events and their real-world counterparts.  
  • Need markdown explaining how each JIRA status maps to queue stages and developer states.

- **2.2 B (Flow charts for report)** ✅ Done  
  • Produced final charts integrated into documentation.

- **2.2 C (Preliminary data collection & stats)** ✅ Done  
  • Validated ETL outputs and computed basic aggregations.  
  • Outcome: data pipeline stable and repeatable.

---

## Meeting 3 — Data Analysis & Analytical Model
- **3.1 Analytical model & assumptions** ⚠️ Partial  
  • Defined queue network structure but formal markdown missing.  
  • Next: create `docs/analytical_model.md` with equations and assumptions.

- **3.2 A (Equations, state matrix, routing params)** ❌ Missing / Partial  
  • Equations not yet centralized; ETL contains raw parameters only.  
  • Action: compile derived parameters and state transition probabilities.

- **3.2 B (Parameter estimation)** ✅ Done  
  • Estimation scripts and outputs verified.  
  • Outcome: working statistical baselines for simulation.

- **3.2 C (Key metrics list)** ⚠️ Partial  
  • Metrics (throughput, utilization, queue length) computed but not documented centrally.  
  • Next: write section listing definitions and symbols.

- **3.2 D (Team workflow simulation model)** ✅ Done  
  • Developed analytical model for team workflow: semi-Markov developer process with states OFF/DEV/REV/TEST.  
  • Introduced stint distribution (per-state jobs count) and overlap management through churn-weighted effort allocation.  
  • Outcome: analytical foundation for developer availability and capacity estimation (~7.5 net h).

---

## Meeting 4 — Simulation Architecture & Coding
- **4.1 Simulation architecture (events/states)** ✅ Done  
  • Modular design of event system and state handlers completed.  
  • Outcome: base simulation runnable end-to-end.

- **4.2 A (Setup repo/code + input base)** ✅ Done  
  • Initialized simulation folder with logging and config templates.

- **4.2 B (Arrivals, transitions, feedback loop)** ✅ Done  
  • Implemented core logic for job arrivals and feedback routing.  
  • Outcome: dynamic flow between queues verified.

- **4.2 C (Service logic, stats, output)** ✅ Done  
  • Finalized service-time handling and statistical outputs.  
  • Logs and CSV results validated.

- **4.3 A (Developer-state & overlap logic implementation)** ✅ Done  
  • Implemented churn-weighted allocator and semi-Markov developer state machine.  
  • Integrated calibration hooks for weights (c_add, c_mod, c_del = 1.0, 1.0, 0.5).  
  • Validated synthetic runs showing correct allocation behavior (~7.5 net h).

---

## Meeting 5 — Verification & Debug
- **5.1 E2E integrated run** ✅ Done  
  • Verified that pipeline runs from data input to output logs without errors.

- **5.2 A (Little’s Law, utilization checks)** ⚠️ Partial  
  • Preliminary calculations performed but missing formal validation markdown.  
  • Next: compute L = λW for each queue and compare to simulation.

- **5.2 B (Parameter sweeps)** ⚠️ Partial  
  • Config generator exists but few experiments run.  
  • Action: automate sweep execution and store outputs.

- **5.2 C (Debug / validation write-up)** ⚠️ Partial  
  • Logs collected but interpretation pending.  
  • Next: create `docs/validation.md` summarizing checks and results.

---

## Meeting 6 — Experiments & Results
- **6.1 Scenarios & variables plan** ⚠️ Partial  
  • Scenarios identified informally; need structured `docs/scenarios.md` with parameter sets.

- **6.2 A (Transient / steady-state runs)** ⚠️ Partial  
  • Simulator supports both modes but outputs not labeled clearly.  
  • Action: tag each run type and compare statistics.

- **6.2 B (Graphs & tables)** ⚠️ Partial  
  • ETL produces rich CSV data; few visuals generated.  
  • Next: create graphs summarizing performance metrics.

- **6.2 C (Experiments write-up)** ❌ Missing  
  • Need markdown document summarizing experiment design, findings, and interpretation.

---

## Meeting 7 — Improvements & Optimization
- **7.1 Select improvement** ❌ Missing  
  • Decide which process optimization to test (e.g., adaptive routing or dynamic stints).

- **7.2 Implement improvement & compare** ❌ Missing  
  • Code and evaluate the chosen improvement vs. baseline runs.  
  • Generate comparison plots and summaries.

- **7.x Interpretation & prep for final** ⚠️ Partial  
  • Preliminary interpretation exists; needs final synthesis for report.

  • Prepare presentation summarizing project evolution, results, and insights.

- **8.3 Rehearsal / Q&A / final polish** ❌ Missing  
  • Perform mock presentation and Q&A; apply final proofreading.
