    make logger as a static variable
    not all logger in bookkeeper & hedwig are static. some class like PendnigReadOp and LedgerEntry would have lots of objects, it might be bad. so this task is to make logger as a static variable if it didn't.

    with benefit, cleaning up the imports when touching that file.

    BK LedgerMetadata: more memory-efficient parsing of configs

    Looking at the most prevalent client-side memory allocations, I noticed that we allocate 4KB every time we open a ledger. This is caused by allocating a 4KB buffer (in TextFormat.toStringBuilder) to account for the maximum possible Protobufs message, which is unnecessary in our case: we know the exact size of the metadata ( << 500 B) and don't need to allocate more.
    TextFormat.merge(Readable, Message.Builder) is the current method we use. This changes to use TextFormat.merge(CharSequence, Message.Builder), which avoids the extra 4K allocation conversion + an extra StringBuilder.

This is a deprecated config and apparently it's not creating new processes for each test as intended. 

Currently the tests are leaking a big number of files and threads due to several reasons: 

 * Tests that instantiate bookies and call shutdown() without calling start() before are creating and initializing the ledger storage but not closing it, leaking threads and several fds
 * ZooKeeperClient sometimes doesn't shutdown the zk handle if the test completes too quickly, leaking sockets.
 * Several tests are passing bad config, so the bookie/client start gets exception (on purpose) and then doesn't clean up some partial objects.
 * ...

That make running the test suite to be dependent on ulimit of the machine. 

Until we can fix (almost) all the test to do proper cleanup, we should make maven to run tests in separated processes.

Bookkeeper is not able to reclaim disk space when it's full
If all disks are full or almost full, both major and minor compactions would be suspended, and only GC will be running. In the current design, this is the right thing to do, because when disks are full, EntryLogger can not allocate any new entry logs any more, and apart from that,  the intention is to prevent disk usage from keep growing.
However, the problem is if we have a mixed of short-lived ledgers and long-lived ledgers in all entry logs, when disks are full, GC wouldn't be able to delete any entry logs, and if compaction is disabled, bookie can't reclaim any disk space any more by itself.

2. Compaction might keep generating duplicated data which would cause disk full
Currently, there's no transactional operation for compaction. In the current CompactionScannerFactory, if it fails to flush entry log file, or fails to flush ledgerCache, the data which is already flushed wouldn't be deleted, and the entry log that is being compacted will be retried again for the next time, which would generate duplicated data.
Moreover, if the entry log being compacted has long-lived data and the compaction keeps failing for some reason(e.g. corrupted entry, corrupted index), it would cause the BK disk usage keep growing until the either the entry log can be garbage collected, or disk full.

This is because the LAC guarantees that the client can read only entries that have been acked from the writer.
The LAC protocol is very useful when there is not direct communication between ""writers"" and ""readers"".

I have an use case in which the ""writer"" blocks until the write is acked (like addEntry) and then it takes the returned id (ledgerId + entryid) and passes it to a ""reader"" which in turn tries to read the entry.

This communication is done out-of-band in respect to BookKeeper and we can assume that the entries has been stored in a durable way (the write as been acked by a quorum of bookies).
As the 'reader' as received a confirmation the the writer as successifully written the entry it can read it without waiting for the piggyback of the LAC of the standard bookkeeper protocol.
This is the normal way of working with transactional databases or with filesystems.

This is kind of ""causal consistency"".

The idea is to add a configuration option to relax the check in asyncreadEntries

this is 4.4 version:
{code}
        if (lastEntry > lastAddConfirmed) {
            LOG.error(""ReadException on ledgerId:{} firstEntry:{} lastEntry:{}"",
                    new Object[] { ledgerId, firstEntry, lastEntry });
            cb.readComplete(BKException.Code.ReadException, this, null, ctx);
            return;
        }
{code}

this is my proposal:
{code}
        if (lastEntry > lastAddConfirmed && !allowReadingAfterLastAddConfirmed) {
            LOG.error(""ReadException on ledgerId:{} firstEntry:{} lastEntry:{}"",
                    new Object[] { ledgerId, firstEntry, lastEntry });
            cb.readComplete(BKException.Code.ReadException, this, null, ctx);
            return;
        }

and entry ids as keys or values. JDK concurrent collections have the overhead
of boxing all the primitive values into objects (eg: long --> Long) that would
need to be allocated from the heap. In addition to that, JDK map implementations
are closed hash tables and they will require at least one more allocation to hold
the linked-list/tree node.

There are already available libraries that offer primitive collections with
zero-allocation, but none of these support concurrent maps/sets.

We have added a handful of specializations, all based on the same implementation
idea. We have a hash table which is broken down into multiple sections. Each
sections, on its own, is an open hash table with linear probing, protected by
a stamped lock.

All insertions, lookups and iterations on these collections are allocation free.

currently re-replicator only uses the view of available/readonly bookies right at the time doing bookie checking. it would accidentally treat a bookie disappeared from zookeeper (e.g. zookeeper session expired, bookie restarted, flapping bookie registration due to network/gc) as lost bookies, which introduce unnecessary re-replication.

Solution:

introduce 'auditorStaleBookieInterval', if a bookie never register in the given interval, it would be marked as 'stale' bookies and re-replicate all ledgers belongs to that bookie. the default value is set 30 minutes.

Fixes:

- refactor bookie watcher to allow notifying bookie list thru BookiesListener
- introduce 'auditorStaleBookieInterval' to be able to mark bookies as 'stale' if bookies aren't registered themselves to zookeeper
- add more info logging about critical steps on re-replication logic

In LedgerHandleAdv in doAsyncAddEntry method, call to addToLength(length) is not synchronized.

addEntry method is supposed to be thread safe, so when addEntry method of LedgerHandleAdv is called concurrently from multiple threads, addToLength will be messed up because its call is not synchrnoized.

in LedgerHandle it is synchronized over 'this'.

2) In LedgerHandleAdv, in asyncAddEntry it is incorrect to add 'op' to 'pendingAddOps' before calling doAsyncAddEntry

 In LedgerHandleAdv, in asyncAddEntry, it is incorrect to add 'op' to 'pendingAddOps' before calling doAsyncAddEntry.

Consider the following example,

Lets say ""asyncAddEntry(final long entryId, final byte[] data, final int offset, final int length, final AddCallback cb, final Object ctx)"" is called with incorrect arguments, and following condition is failed ""(offset < 0 || length < 0 || (offset + length) > data.length)"".

HierarchicalLedgerManager is supposed to work for ledgerids upto length of 10 (its layout is 2-4-4). But because of order issue in HierarchicalLedgerRangeIterator it doesn't work correctly if we create Ledgers of ledgerid length 9 and 10.

Rootcause:- in HierarchicalLedgerRangeIterator, in 'preload' method after getting l1Nodes by calling ""zk.getChildren(ledgerRootPath, null)"",  they need to be sorted, just like l2nodes in 'nextL1Node' method

How it manifests:-
If we try to create Ledgers using LedgerCreateAdv api with ledgerids of lengths 9 and 10, write entries and read entries, it will fail with following exception messages

This should cover cases like planned upgrade, intermittent network connectivity loss, etc. The amount of time to wait can be an option and the default would be to not wait at all(i.e. retain current behavior).

Of course, if more than one bookie goes down within a short interval, we could decide to start auto recovery without waiting.

This issue is to list all of them in one Jira ticket.

1.
MajorCompaction and MinorCompaction are very basic. Either they do it or won’t do it. Proposal is to  add Low Water Mark(LWM) and High Water Mark(HWM) to the disk space. Have different compaction frequency and re-claim %s when the disk space is < low water mark  ,  >  LWM < HWM, > HWM.

2.
MajorCompaction and Minor Compactions are strictly frequency based. They should at least time of the day based, and also run during low system load, and if the system load raises, reduce the compaction depending on the disk availability 

3.
Current code disables compaction when disk space grows beyond configured threshold. There is no exit from this point. Have an option to keep reserved space for compaction, at least 2 entryLog file sizes when isForceGCAllowWhenNoSpace enabled.

4.
Current code toggles READONLY status of the bookie as soon as it falls below the disk storage threshold. Imagine if we keep 95% as the threshold, Bookie becomes RW as soon as it falls below 95 % and few more writes pushes it above 95 and it turns back to RONLY. Use a set of defines (another set of LWM/HWM?) where Bookie turns RO on high end and won't become RW until it hits low end.

5.
Current code never checks if the compaction is enabled or disabled once the major/minor compaction is started. If the bookie goes > disk threshold (95%) and at that compaction is going on, it never checks until it finishes but there may not be disk available for compaction to take place. So check if compaction is enabled after processing every EntryLog.

6.
Current code changes the Bookie Cookie value even when new storage is added. When the cookie changes Bookie becomes a new one, and BK cluster treats it as new bookie. If we have mechanism to keep valid cookie even after adding additional disk space, we may have a chance to bring the bookie back to healthy mode and have compaction going.

7. Bug
CheckPoint was never attempted to complete after once sync failure. There is a TODO in the code for this area.

8.
When the disk is above threshold, Bookie goes to RO. If we have to restart the bookie, on the way back, bookie tries to create new entrylog and other files, which will fail because disk usage is above threshold, hence bookie refuses to come up.",,,2017-06-06T18:13:05.000+0000,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5,"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.

The first problem to solve is to define a clear way to create the client, in 4.4.0 there are several constructors and a builder class.
The presence of many constructors is a burden to carry on for all the future versions, it would be better to have only a single way to boostrap the client.

Another minor issue is that from the point of view of a developer which uses BookKeeper client API it is very difficult to decide which API use,

We should also remove from the public API direct dependencies on third party APIs, like Netty 3.x, and maybe from ZooKeeper too.
At the same time we must support the option for the client to reuse existing expensive shared resources (such as ZooKeeper client, or netty3 HashedWheelTimer)

Since it is checked after password and error explicitly states that digestType mismatched, all that evil hacker has to do is to change digest type to another one. There are only two of them after all.

here is the scenario significantly affected by current behavior:

1. user rolls out clients with digestType set to MAC and creates lots of ledgers.
2. user notices that MAC is slower than CRC32 and decides to change digestType.
3. more ledgers created with CRC32.
4. user tries to read old and new ledgers
-> now old ledgers cannot be read because of the digest type mismatch.

I'll send pull request for review.

- Those add entries (disabled syncs) will be flushed to disks with subsequent sync add entries.

h4. Compacted entries are not properly synced when index is updated

When compacting, we read ""active"" entries from an entry log and we re-append to current entry log. After compacting a number of entries, by default 100K, or at the very end, we need to update the index pointing to the new entry log and offset.

Before updating the index, we need to wait for this entries to be flushed and fsynced, otherwise a bookie crash might leave the index updated, pointing to an invalid offset.

The current code that is supposed to wait until flushed is:

{code:java}
// GarbageCollectorThread.java:178
EntryLocation lastOffset = offsets.get(offsets.size()-1);
long lastOffsetLogId = EntryLogger.logIdForOffset(lastOffset.location);
while (lastOffsetLogId < entryLogger.getLeastUnflushedLogId() && running) {
    synchronized (flushLock) {
        flushLock.wait(1000);
    }

    lastOffset = offsets.get(offsets.size()-1);
    lastOffsetLogId = EntryLogger.logIdForOffset(lastOffset.location);
}

// update the index 
{code}

The condition {{lastOffsetLogId < entryLogger.getLeastUnflushedLogId()}} is wrong, because if the last compacted entry was written in an earlier entry log than the least unflushed log, it means that the entries are already flushed and thus we don't need to wait.

In the normal case what happens is that {{lastOffsetLogId} is actually the current entryLog and it's equal to {{entryLogger.getLeastUnflushedLogId()}}, so we don't wait. But, in this case the entries appended to the current entrylog are not flushed nor synced, hence the problem. 

h4. Exception during index flush

Having an exception when updating the index, combined with the above issue, makes the bookie GC to stop indefinitely. 
What happens is that the offset list is not cleared, and at the next bookie GC iteration it will find the old compacted entries in that list, for which now the entryLogId is less than the current log id, and that makes the while loop to never exit.

Another problem is that, any IOException during the index flush, will make the GC thread to bail out and it will not remove even the entry logs that were compacted and flushed. Next time, these entry logs will be compacted again.

h4. Proposed solution
I think the best solution is to trigger the {{entryLogger.flush()}} form the bookie GC thread before updating the indexes. That would simplify the code and I don't see any disadvantages in doing that. 
Another improvement would be to delete compacted entry logs individually, as soon as the compacted data is flush, without waiting the end of the whole compaction process. 

The advantages are : 
 * If compaction stop halfway, at least we don't have to re-compact what we just compacted
 * Compaction won't require significant space overhead. Today a major compaction can end up reappending a large amount of data and then deleting all the entry logs at the very end, requiring twice the size of the active data set to be stored on disk at some point in time.",,,2016-05-16T21:47:24.000+0000,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

I have opened and worked on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BOOKKEEPER-873 which allows applications to pass-in LedgerId instead of BK client API picking one for them. But that really doesn't offer much flexibility.

Since ledgerId is a long we can't have 128-bit UUIDs as ledgerIDs and this severely restricts the range if we are generating ledgerIDs through a random generator (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BOOKKEEPER-864)

Best solution for this is to offer a real name space, and I believe it is relatively simple than offering 128-bit ledgerIDs.

Analogous to regular filesystem, we treat our ledgerId as inode-number. Create a new name space in ZK with the user provided pretty-name and provide simple mapping at ZK between name-to-ledgerId. This mapping is static, and never changes once created. i.e name-x always points ledgerId-z. Given this most part of bookie code doesn't need to be aware of this mapping, and changes mostly will be confined client code and in create/delete/list paths.",,,2017-10-17T21:28:07.000+0000,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/1,The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.,https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/open.png,Open,1,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/statuscategory/2,2,new,blue-gray,To Do,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jujjuri,jujjuri,jujjuri,https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jujjuri&avatarId=24984,https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jujjuri&avatarId=24984,https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jujjuri&avatarId=24984,https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jujjuri&avatarId=24984,JV Jujjuri,True,America/Los_Angeles,,,,,2016-04-07 14:22:28+00:00,

This feature is to come up with an intelligent placement that distributes entry copies across different classes of storage.

Simply put, say we have SSD based ledger storage and HDD based ledger storage on each system. Instead of putting all copies of entries either on SSD or on HDD, this placement policy maintains one copy on SSD and others on HDD.

- Have at least one copy on SSD and others on HDD.
   - Writer need to be aware of this classification
   - Replication logic need to be aware of this logic.

- While reading attempt to read from SSD first.
  - Reader also need to be aware of this logic.

This will push bookkeeper  towards the long term storage, also can be a stepping store towards introducing storage tiers in the future.

I’m wondering if it is feasible to have a way to launch a Bookie and a Bookkeeper client in the same JVM without using network, valid use cases are:
1) Unit testing 
2) Installations using a single Bookie 

1) Unit testing
For unit testing  I’m using mock classes which reproduce the functions of Bookkeeper but it makes my code more complex. 
Running network-related libraries limits the possibility of running tests in parallel and slows down the overall throughput of the tests

2) Single Bookie deployment
Sometimes I need to launch software which uses Bookkeeper in a single-machine deployment, in this case using an embedded Bookie will let to have only a single JVM process which runs the full stack of the service.

For instance when I’m using Bookkeeper as a commit log I need to implement a commit log which uses Bookkeeper for replicated deployments, a simple “file” based commit log  and a pure in-memory commit log for unit testing.

I think it could be done using Netty LocalServerChannelFactory (and related client-side classes) and some tricks about the use of hostnames, registration on Zookeeper and so on

We have discovered that the BookKeeper servers automatically shutdown without retry upon losing a connection to a quorum of nodes, which is the expected behaviour according to the code.

It is not obvious from the link at http://bookkeeper.apache.org/ under ""Documentation / Admin guide"", that this is the expected behaviour.

Nowadays (on 4.3.1) I must keep that info together with the id of the ledger,  for instance in zookeeper,  but if that reference gets lost there is now way to know how old a ledger is.

I think that this timestamp should be captured on client while calling createLedger or asyncCreateLedger.

In addition to this very common field maybe it would be useful to add a custom byte[] field named ""custom client data"" in order to let the client 'describe' the ledger without the need of extra data on Zookeeper.

While this is very convenient and makes the life of caller very simple and easy,
this model may not be very suitable where application would like to have 
better control.

In order to facilitate applications/users of BK aspiring to have more control
following enhancements are proposed for BK client API:
 
- API enhancement to accept entryID:
Enhance BK client API to pass entryId as an input and the caller must guarantee the following:
    * entryIds are never duplicated
    * entryIds are sequential starting from 0.
    * entryIds have no holes.

- API enhancement to accept LedgerHandle
Applications are allowed to pass-in ledgerId  provided:
  * ledgerId is unique within the cluster. 
  * Or even better, if using GUID (128 bit) virtually guarantees universal
     uniqueness.  
   * Need to bypass current ledgerId generation logic. 

- Allow multiple entities (threads/processes) write to the ledger as long as
   there is only one writer at the given instance of time.

- Currently ledgerHandle interface accepts byteArray as input, but sockets 
  use byteBuffer. We will add additional functions to the new classes to 
  accept both byteBuffers and byteArrays.

- Sijie suggested to create a new classes that extents existing classes to accept LedgerId and entryId as inputs.This avoids any confusion with existing interfaces, and makes it explicit.",,,2017-10-17T21:28:36.000+0000,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/1,The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.,https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/open.png,Open,1,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/statuscategory/2,2,new,blue-gray,To Do,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jujjuri,jujjuri,jujjuri,https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jujjuri&avatarId=24984,https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jujjuri&avatarId=24984,https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jujjuri&avatarId=24984,https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jujjuri&avatarId=24984,JV Jujjuri,True,America/Los_Angeles,,,,,2015-07-27 16:57:08+00:00,

The purpose of the algorithm is to tell us when we have heard a response from enough nodes, that an ack quorum could not possibly have been formed without at least one of the nodes that we have heard responses from.

The current algorithm works when writeQuorum == ackQuorum, as we consider all quorums covered if the first |ackQuorum| nodes in the writeQuorum are covered. However, this doesn't work in the case that it's the middle node in the quorum that we have heard.

Take the example, e:4, w:3, a:2, and we've heard from node 0, and node 2. In this case, it is possible for the write quorum, 1,2,3 to get an ack quorum if 1 and 3 response.

I've attached the log of this happening along with a test case that will trigger the behaviour.

What appears to be happening is that when the fence occurs, the first write after the fence gets an unrecoverable error, so tries to close the ledger. Closing the ledger sets the closed flag on the ledger metadata, and tries to write it, which fails as the metadata in zookeeper was modified by the fencing operation, so the close op fails, resets the closed status for a moment, a write operation gets through, which then fails with a fencing error, so we try to close the ledger, but the other close operation has since closed the ledger in our metadata, so nothing happens, and the write hangs forever.

There's a number of issues here, but foremost, the ledger metadata that the handle is using should only ever represent what is actually in zookeeper. Having various parts of the code flipping bits just explodes the state space. The LedgerMetadata object itself should be immutable, and should only be modified, as a local variable, using a builder, before writing to zookeeper. Only when the zookeeper operation succeeds should we update the reference which LedgerHandle has access to.

There's also a problem in how we handle pendingaddops when we close. Really it shouldn't be possible for a write op to get through after a closure, but we should be defensive here and error out anything that has gotten through, adding a big old log message to alert us that this cases that shouldn't happen, is happening.",,,2016-05-16T21:47:31.000+0000,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

Almost all the comments about the c++ client apply to hedwig as a whole. Hedwig has only had 5 real changes in the last year, only one in 2014. For all intensive purposes, it is inactive, unmaintained and unsupported. AFAIK, noone is using it in production in anything close to the form of the apache codebase.

However, by having it in the codebase, at the same level of bookkeeper-server, we are indicating to users that it is in fact supported software and considered as important as bookkeeper-server. So, I would like to propose that, after the 4.3.0 release, we remove hedwig from the codebase. Obviously, it will still be available in the git/svn history, and in all releases <= 4.3.0.

-The hedwig c++ client has not had any real code change since november 2012. It is not built as part of the main build. It is not tested as part of the main build. It is effectively unmaintained.-

-In addition to this, it contains m4 files whose license status is unclear.-

-I propose we simple remove it from trunk and branch-4.2. The license issue is currently blocking the release of 4.2.3. [~jiannan], [~farrellee], you were the last people to submit anything for the client. Are you using in production?

Step1 : Have three bookies BK1, BK2, BK3
Step2 : Have written ledgers with quorum 2
Step3 : Unfortunately BK2 and BK3 both went down for few moments.

The following logs are flooded in BK1 autorecovery logs. RW is trying to replicate the ledgers, but it simply skip this fragment and moves to next cycle when it sees a replica found in his hand. IMO, we should have a mechanism in place to avoid unnecessary cycles.

The #channelDisconnected() call will then error out the write request. This is due to the fact that the outstanding request map belongs to the PerChannelBookieClient, rather than to the channel, even though they should belong to the socket on which they were sent out on.

The solution would be to move the completions into the ChannelHandlerContext. At the same time, we can get rid of the separate read and add lists. This information can be in the keys. Perhaps this fix can be done as part of the transaction id changes.

So the reader is safe to read all the entries written before LAC.

Currently a bookkeeper reader doesn’t sync LAC with the bookkeeper writer. So a bookkeeper reader has to read LAC (aka LedgerHandle#readLastConfirmed) before getting the latest entries written by the writer.

Such polling behavior results in poor performance:
* Delay on reading entries if we are setting a larger polling interval.
** ReadLastConfirm needs to wait all the responses from all bookies in last ensemble. This constraint is required for Ledger Recovery Procedure, but not for the reader just needs to know latest LAC.
* It might Introduce useless polling loads to bookie servers if we are setting a smaller polling interval.

A notification mechanism is good to reduce round-trips that a reader spent on polling LAC.

As though I was not able to reproduce this in some tries, but
By looking at the logs and code, following seems to be problem

1. BookieWatcher got the notification first for changes in available bookies.
2. PerChannelBookieClient#disconnect() called from BookieWatcher for failed bookies. This has set the 'this.channel=null;'
3. PerChannelBookieClient#channelDisconnected() call came now, and it proceeded silently without notifying errors to read ops.

So client is hung waiting for result.

There should be an optional bk_server.conf setting to allow one to select their preferred network interface to use for the bookie.  Then you could use something like {{NetworkInterface.getByName(PREFERRED_INTERFACE).getInetAddresses()}} instead.  This method is not effected by the /etc/hosts.

An alternative method of registering the bookie that does not rely on the local address would be another possible solution, such as using the DNS like other apache projects (hbase).",,,2013-07-15T15:21:45.000+0000,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5,"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.

   * Assume the ledger id list in local bookie server is *LocalLedgers*
   * At the same time, the ledger id list at metadata storage is *LiveLedgers*
   * Then the ledgers require garbage collection are *LocalLedgers - LiveLedgers*

Under current implementation, an ledger id order guarantee is required when obtain *LiveLedgers* from metadata storage. However, this is unnecessary: we get *LocalLedgers* and we can just remove elements that in *LiveLedgers* one by one in any order.

What's more, without the order requirement when scan all ledger ids, some things become simple:
   * We even don't need radix tree to maintain 64-bits ledger metadata, a hierarchical hash tree is enough (just as what topic metadata management does).
   * Easy to handle 64-bit ledger id backward compatibility for MSLedgerManager:
      ** Currently, for MSLedgerManager, we format ledger id to a fixed length (it's 10 now) digit string to make order scan
      ** When a 64-bit ledger id is used we need to enlarge the fixed length, then old ledger id backward compatibility turns to be a trouble if we require this order guarantee.

As above reasons, it would better to remove specific order requirement from current Scan-And-Compare GC implementation.",,,2017-10-09T09:40:44.000+0000,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5,"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.

the issue could be reproduce by a test case in following steps:

1. Ledger L writing several entries to ensemble A, B, C.
2. C succeed, B failed with slow responses and A failed with unrecoverable issue.
3. L would fail all the pending add ops and close the ledger with lastEntryId = -1. (since no add operations succeed).
4. The ownership of this Ledger is released and transferred to other machines (it is the normal use case for Hedwig).
5. the new owner tried to open Ledger L and recover the ensemble, suppose A, B is back to normal at this case. so L is closed with lastEntryId is not -1.
6. the old owner although closed the ledger, but doesn't blocking the responses for already failed pending add ops. so failures for B would kick in some ensemble changes and since the ledger metadata is already changed by new owner, so it needs to resolve the conflicts and update the ledger metadata with lastEntryId = -1 again. so we get different lastEntryId at different time, which cause inconsistency and data loss.

This task could be divided into several tasks:

1) provide a reconnectable zookeeper client, which wrap the zookeeper client. when session is expired, it created a new zookeeper client to replace the expired one.

2) session handling for bookie server

3) session handling for bookkeeper client.

4) session handling for Hedwig. when session is expired, hedwig should disable ensemble change and ledger change. when the client is recovered from session expired state, hedwig enables ensemble change and ledger change, and it would try to reclaim its owned topic.

the works are available in https://github.com/sijie/bookkeeper/commits/retryable_zk_2. will try to generate the patches after 4.2.0 release.

        try {
            entryLogger.scanEntryLog(entryLogId, new CompactionScanner(entryLogMeta));
            // after moving entries to new entry log, remove this old one
            removeEntryLog(entryLogId);

            compacting.set(false);

{code}

currently compaction code has a bit problem: as the code described above, old entry log is removed after new entries are added to new entry log, but new entry log might not be flushed. if failures happened after removal but before flush, data would be lost.

when I implemented compaction feature in BOOKKEEPER-160, I remembered that I took care of letting entry go back to normal addEntry flow to reflect journal and index. But seems that the addEntry doesn't go thru journal, just move entries between entry log files w/o any flush guarantee.

there are two ideas for this solution:

simple one is to let compaction going to normal addEntry flow (adding entry to ledger storage and putting it in journal). the other one is GC thread either wait for ledger storage to flush in sync thread in one flush interval or force a ledger storage flush before removing entry log files.

BTW, it was hard to design a test case by simulating bookie abnormally shut down itself after entry log files are removed.",,,2013-02-13T15:46:35.000+0000,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

This is a race issue which may cause messages been throttled by mistake, the root cause is ActiveSubscriberState.messageConsumed() and ActiveSubscriberState.deliverNextMessage() may be executed in different threads by AbstractSubscriptionManager and FIFODeliveryManager.

Read the log in attachement around Line 2420 if you want to get more information, here I replay the logs onto the code (Line XX denotes code listed below):
# Messages 1-30 are to be delivered and the message window size in Hub server is 10.
# Messages 1-10 are delivered to subscriber while message 11-30 is throttled by the window size limitation.
# Subscriber calls consume 1-10 asynchronously.
# CONSUME 1 is handled and FIFODeliveryManager continue to deliver message 11.
# Subscriber receive message 11 and quickly ack CONSUME 11 to Hub.
# Now there are two threads operate on a same ActiveSubscriberState:
#* Thread in AbstractSubscriptionManager: call ActiveSubscriberState.messageConsumed() for message 2, 3, 11 (4-10 is still on the way since it's asynchronous consume). Let's assume this thread happen to run in Line (14) for message 11.
#* Thread in FIFODeliveryManager:  Coincidently, it's in Line (36) now (with last delivered 11, last consumed 1 and variable isThrottled is still false).
# If thread in AbstractSubscriptionManager executed before FIFODeliveryManager, then consume operator for 11 does nothing more.
# CONSUME [4-10] will be just ignored by the if statement in Line (2) since lastSeqIdConsumedUtil is now 11.
# Further messages like 12 have no chance to been delivered at this time.

There's 3 possible bookies to select, two of which are already in the ensemble, so a single iteration, if selecting randomly has a 66% chance of selecting a bad bookie. We have to run four times anyhow because it's a parameterized test, giving us a 66*4 % chance of hitting the bug if we only have one iteration. 

Therefore, we should only iterate once. Also, we don't need to write much data. We only care about whats in zk for this test really.

1) suppose Topic T has ledger L1, storing messages starting from 1 - 100.
2) T changed ledger to write entry to ledger L2.
3) Before the entry is added successfully, Subscribe s subscribed topic T. ReadAhead cache tried to schedule a ReadAhead request to scan (103, 104).
4) RangeScanOp in BookKeeperPersistentManager executed to read entry 2 & 3 from L2. but actually there was no entries in L2.

The code in BookKeeperPersistentManager is supposed to not scan any messages whose seq id is larger than lastEntryIdAckedInCurrentLedger. But lastEntryIdAckedInCurrentLedger isn't reset when changing ledger. so when RangeScanOp is executed, last entry id acked in previous ledger was used which causing calculating an error seq id for the boundary checking in RangeScanOp.

The fix would be quite easy to reset lastEntryIdAckedInCurrentLedger when changing ledger.

1) A subscriber setLastConsumeSeqId to move consume ptr. If the consume ptr is moved over consume interval, an update subscription state operation is issued to update to ZooKeeper.

{code}

AbstractSubscriptionManager:

            
            if (subState.setLastConsumeSeqId(consumeSeqId, cfg.getConsumeInterval())) {                updateSubscriptionState(topic, subscriberId, subState, cb, ctx);
            }
{code}

2) when move consume ptr, it also changed in-memory subscription state before the subscription state is persisted to ZooKeeper.

{code}
    public boolean setLastConsumeSeqId(MessageSeqId lastConsumeSeqId, int consumeInterval) {
        long interval = lastConsumeSeqId.getLocalComponent() - subscriptionState.getMsgId().          getLocalComponent();
        if (interval <= 0) {
            return false;
        }

        // set consume seq id when it is larger
        this.lastConsumeSeqId = lastConsumeSeqId;
        if (interval < consumeInterval) {
            return false;
        }

        // subscription state will be updated, marked it as clean
        subscriptionState = SubscriptionState.newBuilder(subscriptionState).                          setMsgId(lastConsumeSeqId).build();
        return true;
    }
{code}

3) MessageConsumedTask runs periodically to delete consumed ledgers. it would use in-memory subscription state to perform such deletion. so if ledger is deleted first and failed to update subscription state. it would cause inconsistent state, when hub restarts and subscriber reconnects, it would use old seq id to start delivering but the ledger has messages with old seq id has been deleted.

{code}
for (InMemorySubscriptionState curSubscription : topicSubscriptions.values()) {
                    if (curSubscription.getSubscriptionState().getMsgId().getLocalComponent() <       minConsumedMessage)
                        minConsumedMessage = curSubscription.getSubscriptionState().getMsgId().       getLocalComponent();
                    hasBound = hasBound && curSubscription.getSubscriptionPreferences().              hasMessageBound();
                }
{code} 

The fix would be let message consume task only use persistence state to performance deletions only.

topic TOPIC has 2 ledgers L1, L2, each ledger has 100 entries.

1) all the 100 entries in L1 has been delivered and consumed.
2) 100 entries have been wrote to L2 but not delivered.
3) L1 is deleted since all its entries have been consumed.
4) hub server shuts down
5) TOPIC recovered L2 and started delivering from 101.

TOPIC was expected to issue a read [0-3] from L2, but a read [100-103] was issued from the exception log, so no entries would be expected to read from L2 at [100-103].

The problem of this issue is that we used 0 and 1 for the start of message id and ledger id even we had some consumed ledgers deleted.

Essentially, the ledger index is a non-clustered index. It is not effective when a large number of ledger entries need to be served, which tend to be scattered around due to interleaving.

Some possible improvements:
1. Change the ledger entries buffer to use a SkipList (or other suitable), sorted on (ledger, entry sequence). When the buffer is flushed, the entry log is written out in the already-sorted order. 

The ""active"" ledger index can point to the entries buffer (SkipList), and fixed up with entry-log position once latter is persisted.

Or, the ledger index can be just rebuilt on demand. The entry log file tail can have index attached (light-weight b-tree, similar with big-table). We need to track per ledger which log files contribute entries to it, so that in-memory index can be rebuilt from the tails of corresponding log files.

2. Use affinity concept to make ensembles of ledgers (belonging to same topic) as identical as possible. This will help above 1. be more effective.

The same thread handles reads and writes. When reads are slow (possibly because of excessive seeks), add entry operations suffer in terms of latencies. Providing separate read and write threads helps in reducing add entry latencies and increasing throughput even when we're facing slow reads. Having a single read thread also results in low disk utilization because seeks can't be ordered efficiently by the OS. Multiple read threads would help in improving the read throughput.

for example in BookieReadWriteTest.TestReadWriteAsyncSingleClient()
1. when called the function lh.asyncAddEntry(entry.array(), this ,sync), the call back function is addComplete(int, LedgerHandle, long, Object)
2. we can see that in addComplete(..) the function will be fail when rc != BKException.Code.OK, and the x.counter++ will not be called never.
3. we assume that the function addComplete(..) is fail. so, in TestReadWriteAsyncSingleClient(), the while loop enter endless loop because sync.counter < numEntriesToWrite is right forever.

Use case: When user tries to run a ZK cluster in multitenant mode,  where more than one client service would like to share a single ZK service instance (cluster). In this case the client services typically want to protect their data (ZK znodes) from access by other services (tenants) on the cluster. Say you are running BK, HBase or ZKFC instances, etc... having authentication/authorization on the znodes is important for both security and helping to ensure that services don't interact negatively (touch each other's data).

Issue is: 
1) Two Workers started and trying to get the lock for same ledger.
2) Both worker found that lock file does not exist.
3) both gone ahead for creating the lock node.
4) One worker failed with NodeExists exception

Then it is just removing the children from the list and go for latch wait for the watch notification.

But here unfortunately we added the watch on lockPath with exists check call. But that time lockPatch really did not exists. SO, the lock may be invalid. Then it will never get the notification when lock has been cleaned by other worker.
Here other worker partly replicated and now the current worker should take lock. But it can not get that notification as it added that watch when node does not exist.

When the bookies and hedwig hubs were restarted, the hubs tried to query the entries for a particular topic, but an exception was always returned and the reads never completed successfully. 

Eventually, we found that the ledger from which entries couldn't be read actually had 2 index files on disk. We use multiple ledger directories. The first file was in ledger directory number 2 and had a size of 0. The other file which actually contained all the data was in directory 4. 

It doesn't seem right that one ledger has 2 index files. Also, the findIndexFile() function returns the first found ledger index file. Should this be patched to 
1) Throw an exception if more than one file exists (if that's the expected behavior)
2) Do something else?

Any thoughts?

Edit: 
For another ledger, there were 2 files again, created within a minute of each other, on separate directories and with the same size. 

I ran bin/bookie shell ledger -m <ledger_number>. For the most recent file, all entries were N/A, but the other file had all the actual entries. 

So, returning the most recent file might not be the best approach?

At 2012-08-15 17:47:42,443, the channel was disconnected as well. 

I believe the following code in the MessageConsumeCallback is causing this problem. 

 Channel topicSubscriberChannel = client.getSubscriber().getChannelForTopic(topicSubscriber);
        HedwigClientImpl.getResponseHandlerFromChannel(topicSubscriberChannel).getSubscribeResponseHandler()
        .messageConsumed(messageConsumeData.msg);

The channel was retrieved without checking if it was closed and then getPipeline().getLast() was called which returned a null value resulting in a NPE. Moreover, we need to check if the returned Response handler is not null because there is a race here if channel.close() is called after we retrieve the channel and before we call messageConsumed(). 

I guess the same applies for other instances where we use this.
Does the above explanation seem right?

The idea is, Whenever it finds the last fragement is under replicated, It can add into PendingReplication list.
There will be a small daemon, which will check for the timeouts of this ledgers. 

Once it timed out , it will trigger the normal replication process if it is not in last fragment. Otherwise, it will fence the ledger and will trigger the replication nomally.

The JMS provider implementation conforming to the 1.1 spec.
The limitations as of now are :



1) No support for Queue's : Hedwig currently does not have a notion of JMS queue's for us to leverage.

2) No support for noLocal : Hedwig DOES NOT conform to JMS model of connection -(n)-> session -(n)-> publisher/subscriber. Each session has a hedwig connection.

Currently I am simulating noLocal, but this IS fragile and works for the duration of connection - ONLY until the message id is still in a LRUCache. As mentioned before, this is a kludge, and not a good solution.

3) Note that everything is durable in hedwig - so we do not support NON_PERSISTENT delivery mode.

4) Calling unsubscribe on a durable subscription will fail if it was NOT created in the current session.
In hedwig, to unsubscribe, we need the subscription id and the topic ... 

To simulate unsubscribe(), we store the subscriberId to topicName mapping when a create* api is invoked. Hence, if create* was NOT called, then we have no way to infer which topic the subscription-id refers to from hedwig, and so cant unsubscribe.

The workaround is - simply create a durable subsriber just as a workaround of this limitation - the topicName will be known to the user/client anyway.


5) Explicit session recovery is not supported.
Reconnection of hedwig session (either explicitly or implicitly by underlying client implementation) will automatically trigger redelivery of un-acknowledged messages.


6) Because of the above, setting the JMSRedelivered flag is almost impossible in a consistent way.

Currently, we simulate it for redelivery due to provider side events : rollback of txn, exception in message listener (primarily).
At best we can simulate it with a kludge - at risk of potentially running out of resources ... this is being investigated : but unlikely to have a clean fix.

7) Hedwig only supports marking all messages until seq-id as received : while JMS indicates ability to acknowledge individual messages.

This distinction is currently unsupported.

8) JMS spec requires
    ""A connection's delivery of incoming messages can be temporarily stopped
using its stop() method. It can be restarted using its start() method. When the connection is stopped, delivery to all the connection’s MessageConsumers is inhibited: synchronous receives block, and messages are not delivered to MessageListeners.""

  We honor this for undelivered messages from server - but if stop is called while there are pending messages yet to be delivered to a listener (or buffered in subscriber for receive), then they will be delivered irrespective of stop().

It elegantly handles the cases where new data is added to a data format. This is useful in the case of something like LedgerMetadata, which may change over time. However, at the moment, whenever we make a change to the LedgerMetadata serialization format we have to break compatibility with old clients. By using protobufs, even if we add something to the format, old clients should be able to read the ledgers. 

We should also change our protocols to use protobufs for the same reason, but this should be done in 4.3.0.

suppose topic T has four messages, message 1 is in ledger 1 while message 2~4
are in ledger 2. Hub server issue scan (1, 2) and scan (3, 4).

If hub server works correctly, it just tried to read entry 0 in ledger 1 and
entry 0 in ledger 2 during scan (1,2), while reading entry 1, 2 in ledger 2
during scan (3,4).

But unfortunately, after fixing BOOKKEEPER-215, scan (1,2) would read 0 in
ledger 1 and read 0, 1 in ledger 2. so reading entry 1 of ledger 2 would be
issued concurrently in different scans and one reading would fail without any callback (this issue is BOOKKEEPER-49).

Then the systems would be blocked there wait for the response of reading 1 of
ledger 2 and no messages would be delivered.


To fix this issue, two thing would be done.

1) fix scan issue in hub server to avoid overlapping scanning.
2) fix read issue in bookkeeper client.

fixing 1) could resolve this issue, but it would be better to fix 2) also. it should be in jira BOOKKEEPER-49.",,,2013-02-13T15:46:36.000+0000,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

When analyzed more, the root cause is:

BookKeeper.java:
--------------------
In the constructor of BookKeeper, immediately after creating the ZK client , it is going to bookieWatcher.readBookiesBlocking() for available bookies from ZK server before reaching SyncConnected event.

I think, we would properly use the existing countdown latch and wait till ZooKeeper client connection establishment before continue reading Bookies.

client -> proxy server 1 -> hedwig
       \> proxy server 2 />

when client would connect to either proxy server to receive messages, the proxy server would setup subscription channel to hedwig server.

we just want client to be simple, so when the channel between client and proxy server is broken, client will try to connect to proxy servers thru VIP. it might connect to other proxy server. for example, first time client connects to proxy server 1, but the client found the connection is broken, it connects to proxy server 2. when proxy server 2 tried to setup subscription channel to hedwig, hedwig found that this subscription has existed before occupied by proxy server 1.

the panic here is that proxy server 1 only disconnect old subscription channel only when it detected the channel between client and itself is broken. The detection might be delayed due to several reasons. so it might increment the latency that messages are pushed to real client.

so we try to introduce a subscription mode called CREATE_OR_ATTACH_OR_KILL mode.

when a subscriber use this subscription mode, it would kill old existed subscription channel. when using this subscription mode, we would turn off auto-reconnect functionality in hedwig client and just tell client about the channel disconnected event so client could do its logic when channel is detected.

in order to provide some admin tool for admin guys to debug/operate, we provide ADMIN mode. if a subscriber attach to a subscription using ADMIN mode, its subscription channel would never be killed, then it is safe to guarantee admin operations.

So GarbageCollectorThread would gc those deleted entry log files again. Then there is lots of such kind of error messages, these are noise error message but doesn't affect the logic.

This is causing a deadlock under high load. What I've observed is the following - There are a fixed number of threads created by OrderedSafeExecutor(mainWorkerPool in BookKeeper) and this is used to execute operations by PerChannelBookieClient. Under high load, the bookies are not able to satisfy requests at the rate at which they are being generated. This exhausts all permits in the Semaphore and any further operations block on lh.opCounterSem.acquire(). In this scenario, if the connection to the bookies is shut down, channelDisconnected in PerChannelBookieClient tries to error out all outstanding entries. The errorOutReadKey and errorOutAddKey functions enqueue these operations in the same mainWorkerPool, all threads in which are blocked on acquire. So, handleBookieFailure is never executed and the server stops responding. 

Blocking operations in a fixed size thread pool doesn't sound quite right. Temporarily, I fixed this by having another ExecutorService for every PerChannelBookieClient and queuing the operations from the errorOut* functions in it, but this is just a quick fix. I feel that the server shouldn't rely on LedgerHandle to throttle connections, but do this itself. Any other ideas on how to fix this? I'd be happy to contribute a patch.

The app does the following:

# It creates initially a number of ledgers, say 2000;
# Once it reaches 2000, for each new ledger it creates, it deletes the one at the head of the list;
# Before closing the ledger, it adds 5 entries of 1k, just to generate some traffic for any given ledger.

What I tried to achieve is to have thousands of active ledgers and delete new ledgers as I create new ones. I'll post a link to my test code later. 

At some point, one bookie stops responding. The bookie seems to be up, but it is not responsive. Looking at the logs, this is what I see:

Currently, the write set and the ack set are the same for a ledger. Internal changes to support these cases include changes to LedgerHandle and PendingAddOp. We also need to add a call to the client API to accept different sizes for the write set and the ack set upon ledger creation.

when the number of open ledgers reaches more than openFileLimit, a file info will be closed and removed from opened ledgers list. And after BOOKKEEPER-137, the ledger index file creation delayed until necessary.

suppose ledger l is removed from opened ledger list, and its index file haven't been created.
new add entries operations of other ledgers came into bookie server, a new page need to be grab for them. so bookie server may need to flush the dirty pages of ledger l(when page cache is full). and the flush would fail due to NoLedgerException (no index file found).

actually the ledger l isn't lost, it could be recovered if restarting bookie server, but the bookie server would not work well on adding entries. 

a proposal solution is that we need to force index creation when the ledger is evicted from open ledgers list.

then we did some investigation on failed ledger:

first looked into ledger 114724's index file.

{code}
entry 75        :       (log:11, pos: 100526580)
entry 76        :       (log:11, pos: 101849530)
entry 77        :       (log:11, pos: 103176596)
entry 78        :       (log:11, pos: 104403977)
entry 79        :       (log:11, pos: 105756017)
entry 80        :       (log:11, pos: 106740803)
entry 81        :       (log:0, pos: 73365)
entry 82        :       (log:0, pos: 1366625)
entry 83        :       (log:0, pos: 2719276)
entry 84        :       (log:0, pos: 4065142)
{code}

from entry 80, the data is written in 0 entry log which is less than 11. (means data is written to an older entry log file)

then we looked into ledger directory as below

{code}
2147483550 Mar  5 11:30 /var/bookkeeper/ledger/0.log
  94122988 Mar  5 11:33 /var/bookkeeper/ledger/1.log
1984247565 Mar  5 11:34 /var/bookkeeper/ledger/2.log
    288376 Mar  5 11:34 /var/bookkeeper/ledger/3.log
 747151813 Mar  6 03:17 /var/bookkeeper/ledger/4.log
 410381287 Mar  6 07:43 /var/bookkeeper/ledger/5.log
2147483363 Feb 27 19:59 /var/bookkeeper/ledger/7.log
2147483565 Feb 29 09:40 /var/bookkeeper/ledger/9.log
1691783168 Mar  1 03:22 /var/bookkeeper/ledger/a.log
 125556720 Mar  1 08:30 /var/bookkeeper/ledger/b.log
         0 Mar  1 08:33 /var/bookkeeper/ledger/c.log
{code}

the 0-5 entry log files are overwritten.

looked into the code, found that when bookie server failed to read lastLogId, it would set the lastLogId to -1. then start writing entry log files from 0. and also there is not checking about the existen of the entry log file.

it would better to scan the directories to found the biggest log id and start from it. and check whether the file exists or not when creating a new entry log file.

this issue can be reproduced by following sequence.

index file missing:

1) create ledger 1 without writing any entries
2) open ledger 1 which causes a recoveryRead entry(0) sent to bookie server. then an empty page is put in pageTable by mistake as below. (we should call updatePage first to check whether bookie server has this ledger)
{code}
                 // in ledgerCache#getEntryOffset
                 lep = grabCleanPage(ledger, pageEntry);
                 synchronized(this) {
                     putIntoTable(pages, lep);
                 }
                 updatePage(lep);
{code}
3) open ledger 2 to write serval entries. a meta entry and several data entries would be put in journal.
4) SyncThread executes to flush ledger. it first flush ledger 1, although ledger 1 has an empty page which is clean, but the code still need to call #getFileInfo, which will cause an NoLedgerException fail the flush. unfortunately, the SyncThread caught this exception and just output an error message then rollLog. the result is ledger 2 is not flushed, and its journal entries would not be replayed after restarted.
{code}
                 lastLogMark.markLog();
 
                 try {
                     ledgerCache.flushLedger(true);

2) doRecovery read lastAddConfirmed + 1 (2). it would return right data since there is still 2 replicas.
3) doRecovery add entry 2. but it would fail since there is not enough bookies to form a new ensemble.
4) this ledger will be closed with lastAddConfirmed (1). entry 2 will be lost.

this issue happened in hub server. old ledger will be recovered and closed when changing ownership. so published messages would be lost.

we should not close ledger when we encountered exception during recovery adding, otherwise we would lose entries.",,,2012-10-22T14:50:18.000+0000,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

In systems with a primary/backup architecture, the primary will write state updates to the WAL. If the primary dies the backup comes online, reads the WAL to get the latest state and starts serving requests. However, if the primary was only partitioned from the network, or stuck in a long GC, a split brain occurs. Both primary and backup can service client requests. 

Fencing(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing_%28computing%29) ensures that this cannot happen. With fencing, the backup can close the WAL of the primary, and cause any subsequent attempt by the primary to write to the WAL to give an error. 

We fence a ledger whenever it is opened by another client using BookKeeper#openLedger. BookKeeper#openLedgerNoRecovery will not fence.
The opening client marks the ledger as fenced in zookeeper, and then sends a readEntry message to a all of bookies with the DO_FENCING flag set. Once at least 1 bookie in each possible quorum of bookies have responded, we can proceed with opening the ledger. Any subsequent attempt to write to the ledger will fail as it will not be able to write to a quorum without one of the bookie in the quorum responding with a ledger fenced error. The client will also be unable to change the quorum without seeing that the ledger has been marked as fenced in zookeeper.

ReadLastConfirmOp callback on readEntryComplete.
a) first decrement numResponsePending
b) then increment validResponses
c) check validResponses to callback with OK
b) check numResponsePending to callback with LedgerRecoveryException

support two callbacks returns on readEntryComplete: A, B. (quorum/ensemble size : 2)

a) A first decrement numResponsePending from 2 to 1.
b) A increment validResponses from 0 to 1.
c) B then decrement numResponsePending from 1 to 0.

(i.e. without needing to deserialize the content of the message)

Filtering could use a subset of SQL (like in the JMS spec), leading to queries such as : 
""header1 like 'a' AND header2 IS NOT NULL"" 


For that purpose, I propose to add customizable metadata to the definition of Hedwig messages, as header fields.

Metadata must be customizable because it may be arbitrary. We should provide ""map-like"" containers according to the type of the metadata field. Metadata fields would be accessed by name.

There are predefined headers for JMS that could be added as metadata fields such as : destination (~topic), delivery mode (persistent or not), expiration, priority, timestamp, correlation id (link to other message), reply to, type and redelivered. I think only a subset of these should be predefined headers, if any.

Adding metadata fields to Hedwig messages implies modifying the message definition, which does not break backward compatibility when those fields are added as optional in the protocol buffer definition.

Usage : hedwig_console [options] COMMAND [argument ...]

(if no COMMAND specified, hedwig_console will enter interactive mode.)

OPTIONS:

{quote}
   --zkquorums            the quorum list of zookeeper cluster
   --zktimeout            timeout of zookeeper client
   --zk_hedwig_prefix     the prefix of zookeeper path to store hedwig metadata
   --region               which region of hedwig to connect
   --consume_interval     the consume interval of hub server
{quote}

COMMANDS:

* pub <topic> <message>
** Publish <message> to the specified <topic>. 

* sub <topic> <subscriber_id> [mode]
** Subscribe the specified <topic> as subscriber <subscriber_id>. (NOTE: only run in INTERACTIVE mode now) 
** mode: subscription mode. available values are 0, 1, 2.
*** 0 = CREATE : create the subscription if not subscription before.
*** 1 = ATTACH (default) : attach the subscription
*** 2 = CREATE_OR_ATTACH : if the subscription is not existed, create the subscription then attach. 

* closesub <topic> <subscriber_id>
** Close subscription of subscriber <subscriber_id>. (NOTE: it just close the subscription connection and do cleanup work in client-side, without REMOVING subscription state from server side) 

* unsub <topic> <subscriber_id>
** Remove subscription state of subscriber <subscriber_id>. the subscription state of subscriber <subscriber_id> will be removed from server side. 

* consume <topic> <subscriber_id> <num_messages_to_consume>
** Move the subscription ptr of subscriber <subscriber_id> from ptr to ptr + num_messages_to_consume. 
* consumeto <topic> <subscriber_id> <message_id>
** Move the subscription ptr of subscriber <subscriber_id> from ptr to <message_id>. 
** NOTE: consume*/*consumeto just sent consume request to hub server and hub server move the subscription ptr in its memory. Hub server lazily persists the subscription ptr to zookeeper. the default persist interval in hub server is 50 messages. so use DESCRIBE TOPIC to show subscription, the subscription ptr might be not changed. 

* pubsub <topic> <subscriber_id_prefix> <timeout_secs> <message_prefix>
** A test command to test healthy of hedwig cluster. 

*# sub <topic> as subscriber <subscriber_id_prefix>_<cur_time> .
*# subscriber <subscriber_id_prefix>_<cur_time> will wait a message until <timeout_secs> secs.
*# publish a message <message_prefix>_<cur_time> to topic <topic> .
*# when subscriber <subscriber_id_prefix> receive the message, it will check the message is the published message
*# received message or timeout, subscriber <subscriber_id_prefix> will unsubscribe the <topic>

* show topics
** list all existing topics. (NOTE: since we fetch topic lists from zookeeper, we may got PacketLenException when we have millions of topics. it doesn't affect system, just can't display the topic list) 

* describe topic <topic>
** show state of a specified topic, including topic owner, topic persistent information, topic subscriber list and their subscription states.

*** no <start_msg_id> specified : readtopic will start from <least_consumed_message_id> + 1 of its subscribers. in above exmaple, ""readtopic ttttt"" will start from 50. if there is no subscription, it will start from 1.
*** <start_msg_id> specified : since messages consumed will be removed by garbage collection. so readtopic tries to not read consumed message, it will start from MAX( <start_msg_id> , <least_consumed_message_id> ). 

*** Message Format
**** MsgId : include two parts: first part is which region the message is published from, second part is message id.
**** SrcRegion : region name

The message handler user set might be overwritten incorrectly. 

When handling channelDisconnected event, we try to reconnect to Hedwig server. After the connection is created and subscribed, we'll call StartDelivery() to recover the message handler to the original one of the disconnected connection. But if during this process, user calls StartDelivery() to set a new message handler, it will get overwritten to the original one.

The process can be demonstrated as below:

|| main thread || netty worker thread ||
| StartDelivery(messageHandlerA) | |
| (connection Broken here, and recovered later...) |
|                                             | ResponseHandler::channelDisconnected()   (connection disconnected event received) |
|                                             | new SubscribeReconnectCallback(subHandler.getMessageHandler()) (store messageHandlerA in SubscribeReconnectCallback to recover later) |
|                                             | client.doConnect() (try reconnect)  |
|                                             | doSubUnsub() (resubscribe) |
|                                             | SubscriberResponseHandler::handleSubscribeResponse()  (subscription succeeds) |
| StartDelivery(messageHandlderB)             |                                                                               |
|                                             | SubscribeReconnectCallback::operationFinished()                               |
|                                             | StartDelvery(messageHandlerA)   (messageHandler get overwritten)              |   

I can stably reproduce this by simulating this race condition by put some sleep in ResponseHandler.

I think essentially speaking we should not store messageHandler in ResponseHandler, since the message handler is supposed to be bound to connection. Instead, no matter which connection is in use, we should use the same messageHandler, the one user set last time. So I think we should change to store messageHandler in the HedwigSubscriber, in this way we don't need to recover the handler in connection recovery and thus won't face this race condition.

I'm having an issue with the LedgerHandle#addEntry api.

[1] best illustrates it. I'm buffering namenode transactions in the stream and only transmitting when either flush is called or I have enough data to pass my threshold. This means I have a byte buffer in my class which I fill up as new transactions come in. When I transmit, I set this buffer as an entry to bookkeeper. I.e. N whole namenode transactions will be contained in 1 single bk entry. 

The problem is this byte buffer (DataOutputBuffer in this case). I reuse the same buffer over and over. But this buffer has a fixed size. If I transmit before it is full, the whole buffer size will be transmitted anyhow. If the buffer is being reused, this will retransmit old transactions out of order. For example, in the first use, the buffer fills with, [a,b,c,d,e] and adds this as an entry and resets the byte buffer. Then transaction f is  added and flushed, in this case [f,b,c,d,e] is not transmitted. 

What I need is the ability to set offset and length in the byte[] passed to addEntry. Is there a reason this wasn't added in the initial implementation? If not, and if you agree this is a valid usecase, ill open a JIRA and add this functionality. Im getting around this now by doing an extra Array.copyOf which is less than ideal.

Description
BookKeeper is a distributed write ahead log with client & server written in Java. BookKeeper client & server also use ZooKeeper. There is a BookKeeper API that clients can use to integrate write ahead logging into their application. It would be a lot easier if applications could use BK without changes to the client application through use of a file system api (FUSE). The project would involve implementing a C interface for BookKeeper (Java already exists) and implementing the FUSE module.

Example use: the write ahead log in mysql, called binlogs are typically written to the local filesystem using the std filesystem api. We could modify mysql to use BooKeeper, however if we had a BK FUSE module we could run it (mysql) w/o any modification and get the performance/reliability of a distributed write ahead log.",,,2017-10-09T09:35:17.000+0000,https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5,"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.

 I was thinking of having a configuration parameter to state how often a writer should update the hint on ZooKeeper (e.g., every 1000 requests, every 10,000 requests).
